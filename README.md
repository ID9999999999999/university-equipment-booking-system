# University Equipment Booking System

A cross-platform university equipment booking and resource scheduling system for university laboratories and educational departments.

The system allows students, teachers, laboratory managers, technicians, and administrators to manage equipment reservations, maintenance windows, repair tickets, and audit logs.

## Core Engineering Rule

The central rule of the project is:

> No two active bookings may overlap for the same equipment item.

This rule is enforced by the backend booking kernel and verified through automated Node.js test scripts.

## Local Environment Notes

Docker is not used at the moment.

Reason:

- Docker does not work on the current machine because virtualization is disabled.

PostgreSQL Windows Service is also not used.

Reason:

- The PostgreSQL Windows Service caused error `1067`.

The working solution is to run PostgreSQL manually from CMD.

## Booking Kernel Logic

The system protects the invariant:

```txt
No two active bookings may overlap for the same equipment.
```

Active booking statuses checked by the booking kernel:

```txt
PENDING
APPROVED
CHECKED_OUT
```

Maintenance statuses that block booking:

```txt
SCHEDULED
ACTIVE
```

The overlap condition is:

```txt
existing.startTime < requested.endTime
AND
existing.endTime > requested.startTime
```

This allows adjacent bookings:

```txt
Existing booking: 10:00 - 12:00
New booking:      12:00 - 14:00
Result: allowed
```

## Current Limitations

This is an educational university project and not yet a production system.

Current limitations:

- No real authentication system yet
- Role checks currently use demo users
- No Flutter UI yet
- No file upload for repair evidence yet
- No email notifications yet
- No deployment yet
- No Docker usage because local virtualization is disabled

---

## Planned Next Steps

Recommended next steps:

```txt
1. Add Flutter UI.
2. Add simple demo authentication or user selector.
3. Add dashboard screens.
4. Add screenshots and evidence folder.
5. Improve README with screenshots.
6. Push clean final version to GitHub.
7. Prepare final project defense notes.
```

## Defense Summary

This project is not just a simple CRUD application.

It implements a conflict-aware reservation kernel for university equipment booking.

The backend enforces booking time validity, prevents overlapping reservations, blocks bookings during active maintenance windows, supports institutional approval flow, tracks equipment status, manages repair tickets, and records audit logs for traceability.

The most important proof is that the booking kernel has been tested through automated scripts and all core backend tests pass successfully.
